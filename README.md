# Generative Music Project using Max/MSP

This project, entitled 'gtive', is my first large-scale endeavour with the Max programming language. I applied generative techniques to create fresh musical ideas based on given inputs.

# Motivation

### New music
It's hard to create new music. In fact, some people conform to the notion that all music has been created. All permutations of notes, harmonies, and rhythmic patterns have been realized at some time in history. I think I agree.

What else is there to do? Western classical composers seem to have explored every dimension of music. All forms of popular music are derivations of the musical elements--melody, harmony, rhythm--of classical music.


### How do musicians compose?

If we look at music composition--the act of creating 'new' music, what are the pain points of this process?

The composition process begins when the artist gets hit with a wave of inspiration. Then, through improvisation, applying musical techniques, or even mathematical formulas, the composition is completed. I'm fascinated by jazz improvisation purely because of this--you're composing on the fly. 'Real' composition feels too slow, because you have to mull over every sound, whereas in improvisation you just have to go with whatever is realized through your instrument.

In improvisation, ideas come and go. It is up to the artist to develop the idea and take it wherever they want it to go. So, in composition, the idea-generation process is too slow. It's unncessary for an artist to mull over an idea when they could invest their creative energy into the idea-development process. Because an idea is just an idea. It has no value, and it could only consist of two notes:

Beethoven took a motif consisting of two notes and turned it into arguably the most famous symphony ever.


### Idea-generation

I created 'gtive' to accelerate the idea-generation process. I am applying generative techniques on a set of inputs to create a set of unpredictable outputs. The key is randomness. By having stochastic processes triggering other stochastic processes, I end up with an idea that is fresh and unique.

The idea for 'gtive' comes from the concept of creativity in music.


In the pursuit of composing pieces of music that reflect both myself and my environment, the idea-generation process is tedious, and with the help of software, it could be expedited.
